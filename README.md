# Dorm Room

Enables anyone to adjust and set my lights.

1. [Dorm Room Server](https://github.com/atfinke/Dorm-Room-Server): Runs on Google App Engine. Generates the public website based on the published effects in the client repo. Then creates issues in the dorm repo when lights should update.
2. [Dorm Room Client](https://github.com/atfinke/Dorm-Room-Client): Runs on local iMac. Checks for new issues in the dorm repo and updates lights accordingly.
3. [Dorm Public](https://github.com/AndrewDorm/Public): Repo used to track light updates.
